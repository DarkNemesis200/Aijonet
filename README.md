# Palliative Care Survey Device

Device built off of the Telstra 2018 Development Kit Arduino board originally for the Telstra Innovation Competition 2018 (TIC2018).

The device is designed to ask at home palliative care patients questions allowing their doctors and caretakers to keep tabs on their health. The device utilises the CATM1 wireless network to send responses to a secure server which will eventually have machine learning code written in R allowing the server to predict which patients need may need to be checked up upon soon. The device also gps capability allowing for the possibility of calling an ambulance out to the patient in extreme circumstances.
